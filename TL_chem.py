# # ChemBERTa × TransformerLens: mechanistic interpretability notebook
#
# **Goal** – Load a fine‑tuned ChemBERTa checkpoint, port its encoder into
# [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda‑io/TransformerLens) (TL),
# validate it is functionally the same as the original model, and run a
# round of exploratory mechanistic interpretability analyses and visualizations
# (activation patching, neuron ablations, logit-lens probes,
# attention maps, residual‑stream norms).  
# This notebook is used for development. After a technique works, it is moved to
# an independent Python file and imported to ensure modularity.
